            <p>China appears to have finally shaken off the dark clouds of the COVID-19 era as the summer of 2024 looms.
                The stringent measures of lockdowns, masks, and quarantines are becoming relics of the past. With these
                barriers lifted, there's a palpable sense of anticipation across China. On the eve of the Dragon Year's
                New Year's Eve, discussions at the family dinner table started to shift from fears about virus
                infections or the necessity of doing a nucleic acid test to making vacation travel plans. Every
                household seemed to be brimming anew with hope for the future.
            </p>
            <p>From urban skyscrapers to rural landscapes, Chinese families are on the brink of embracing a potentially
                transformative economic upswing. The questions on everyone's lips are not just about adding another dish
                to the dinner table but about larger aspirations like owning a new car. For a better tomorrow, families
                are starting to look for ways to revive their own economic situation and think about moving forward to a
                better tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p>But how will these aspirations unfold into reality? This is a question not just for individual families
                but for the entire nation.
                There is an old Chinese phase called ÂâçËΩ¶‰πãÈâ¥ that can be translated into English as "a lesson from the
                past" or "a warning from the past." It refers to learning from the mistakes or experiences of those who
                have gone before to avoid similar pitfalls.
                Related to the economic issues people are discussing now, it reminds us of the famous term "Business
                Cycle." Here, the concept of the Business Cycle becomes a lens through which we might forecast the
                future. Reflecting on a decade of robust growth, should we look back to chart our path forward? This
                isn't a solitary quest.
            </p>

            <p>According to a survey by the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), which contrasts China's steady
                development over the past 30 years with the turbulent economic trajectories in the West, it's worth
                pondering whether China's model offers a blueprint for sustainable growth.

            <p>The China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), initiated by Peking University in 2010, provides a biennial,
                longitudinal survey collecting extensive data on Chinese families and communities. It captures economic
                activities, education outcomes, family dynamics, and health, among other factors. Since 2010 to 2020,
                its surveys have been conducted every two years.Using computer-assisted interviews, the survey tracks
                nearly 15,000 families to ensure a fully representative national coverage, with a focus on five
                provinces for detailed regional analysis. CFPS's rich, longitudinal data makes it invaluable for
                understanding the evolving landscape of Chinese familial and economic life, underpinning our study of
                the profound changes observed in Chinese households over the past two decades and offering rich

            <h3>Family1</h3>
            <p>This family of three has one breadwinner who is already 53-years-old and still toils to support one child
                whose education costs 12,000 yuan, one-third of the family‚Äôs expenditure.
                But their rented home, at only 500 yuan a month and only 1.66% of their expenditure, is quite a humble
                setting for the daily challenges of their life, complicated further by a debt of 40,000 yuan. Their
                situation presents a stark contrast against Hebei‚Äôs economic backdrop, where the annual income varies,
                but educational spending unexpectedly becomes the most significant portion of family budgets. This
                family's struggles mirror the delicate balance many face, as they invest in their child‚Äôs future while
                navigating the present's financial constraints.
                The pillar of the household who works, aged 53, has only received a middle school education. Surveys
                indicate that his workplace is located in the local village or county, yet his satisfaction with his job
                is merely a 2 out of a maximum of 5, indicating considerable discontent. This dissatisfaction seems to
                permeate various aspects of his life, with his overall satisfaction level toward his life standing at
                only 3 out of 5. However, in a survey conducted in 2018, he reported having an optimistic and positive
                image, declaring a 5 in being confident about the future.

            <div class="articleWrapper">
            <h3>Family2</h3>
            <p>This household was once a "big family," spanning three generations under one roof. However, over time,
                the children have moved out to establish their own families. The third generation, represented by
                children born in the 1990s, now forms the nucleus of this household. Like the first family, the parents
                have also received only a middle school education, and the people work outside also within the confines
                of their township, unable to venture beyond its boundaries.
                The first aspect about their life that is noteworthy is their accommodation costs which exceed 4,000
                yuan in rent, making it the highest among these three families. This substantial expenditure,
                considering the average rent across Hebei based on Sina Finance data in 2021 was 16 yuan per capita
                rent/square meter, indicates a significant financial burden. With such rent, they could almost afford a
                266-square-meter house. Given the provincial average monthly income trailing behind their rent, this
                family's spending on housing alone suggests a financial stretch, indicative of the sacrifices made by
                many in pursuit of economic stability.
                This family shares a similar educational background as Family 1. However, with a total annual income of
                50,000 yuan, they outpace the first family by 20,000 yuan. While the first household expressed a
                satisfaction level of 2 out of 5 in 2018, the second household consistently maintained a higher level of
                satisfaction, scoring 4 out of 5 in both 2018 and 2020. This trend appears to correlate with their
                improved income situation.

            <div class="articleWrapper">
            <h3>Family3</h3>
            <p>The third family, unlike the previous two, embodies a distinct economic dynamic, relying on real estate
                to sustain their livelihoods. This two-person household, without any employment, finds their economic
                stability in property ownership. Their house, valued at 600,000 yuan, stands as their primary asset,
                complemented by modest savings of 20,000 yuan. Notably, they are unencumbered by debt, which sets them
                apart from many other households in Hebei.
                Despite their lack of traditional employment, this family generates an annual income of 72,000 yuan,
                likely derived from renting out their property. This income stream, while atypical in Hebei, where
                rental income is not a common source of livelihood, allows them to surpass the average disposable income
                for the region.
                In contrast to families burdened by high rents and limited savings, this family's financial situation
                provides a sense of stability and security. Their prudent financial management is evident in their
                ability to maintain their property and generate income from it without relying on physical labor.
                Moreover, their confidence in the future seems to also benefit from this precious property which has
                remained relatively high, with only a marginal decrease from a 5 in 2018 to a 4 in 2020, despite the
                economic turbulence induced by the COVID.
                This family's profile offers an intriguing juxtaposition to the narratives of the previous two
                households especially when their age also subtly reflects the various stages of human life. While the
                first family, they still believe in the transformative power of education amidst financial constraints
                so they put almost half of their effort into cultivating a ‚Äúscholar‚Äù.

        <p>Before diving into the data, it's evident from the design of the CFPS itself that there's an apparent
            inclination towards stratifying the economic study of families across various provinces and cities in China.
        </p>
        <p>Over the last two decades, every province and city in China has demonstrated unique income trajectories. The
            China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) meticulously categorized these into large provinces like Shanghai,
            Liaoning, Henan, Gansu, and Guangdong, and smaller counterparts based on criteria like local GDP per capita,
            which served as a key index for socioeconomic status within administrative units. This survey approach
            reveals stark contrasts: while 1,600 households per large province were surveyed, only 400 were approached
            in each of the remaining smaller provinces, underscoring a significant disparity in data granularity.
        </p>
        <p>Yet amidst this array of layered urban landscapes, we've identified a province that, until recent years,
            remained largely unnoticed. In 2017, it surged into the limelight, only to experience a precipitous fall
            thereafter‚ÄîHebei.
        </p>
        <p>Despite not being categorized among the largest provinces in the CFPS survey, Hebei holds considerable
            strategic importance within the Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei) region. The province faces substantial
            economic development challenges, notably in achieving environmental targets and fostering a green economy.
        </p>
        <p>In the geographical chessboard of Northern China, Hebei stands as a crucial piece, enveloped by Beijing on
            three sides and lying on the vast North China Plain. Together with Beijing and Tianjin, it forms an
            equilateral triangle at the heart of a thriving plain, benefitting from the convenience of modern transit
            routes.
        </p>

        <p>Major transit routes like the Da-Guang Expressway, Jing-Jiu Railway, and Bao-Cang Expressway weave a network
            that connects cities such as Shijiazhuang and Baoding within a half-hour's commute. With the new Beijing
            Airport approximately 55 kilometers away, Hebei is well-positioned to satisfy the developmental needs of
            high-end, high-tech industries. It is also home to the North China Plain's largest freshwater lake,
            Baiyangdian, and is graced by the convergence of rivers like the Cao River and the South Reject Horse River,
            adding to its ecological appeal.
        </p>
        <p>By all accounts, Hebei's geographical positioning seems to be a promising platform from which it could leap
            into the ranks of first-tier cities. However, the CFPS does not recognize it as a major city. Moreover,
            after taking office in 2013, President Xi Jinping proclaimed Hebei a "Metropolitan Auxiliary Node City" in
            response to a report on the coordinated development of the Jing-Jin-Ji region.
        </p>
        <p>The Hebei Provincial New Urbanization Plan, released on March 26, 2014, clarified Baoding's role in
            alleviating Beijing's capital functions, translating to the relocation of administrative institutions,
            corporate headquarters, financial entities, universities, and research institutes from Beijing to Hebei
            prefecture-level city Baoding.
            This narrative, when woven into Hebei's fabric, always seems to return to one central theme: supporting and
            complementing Beijing's development. For a province ranked only 23rd in national GDP, there appears to be a
            dissonance between its economic status and the potential its geographical position suggests.
            This seeming paradox is further endorsed by the design and outcomes of the CFPS survey. In 2020, Hebei's
            actual household survey participation hit 728, surpassing the initial allocation of 400 and nearing
            Shanghai's numbers, with an oversample rate of 1.8 in 2020 and 1.57 for the past decades.
            This suggests an untold story about millions of lives in a land often cast as a mere 'supporting actor,'
            locked into an ambiguous position. As they continuously channel resources into Beijing, the people of Hebei
            face their own conundrum: in the grand narrative of regional symbiosis and national development, where do
            they stand? What is the future of their livelihood as they support the metropolis, yet seek their own
            identity and prosperity?

        <div class = "articleWrapper">
           <p>Shifting our gaze from the broad strokes of Hebei‚Äôs economic landscape to the intimate contours of home, we
            pivot to the lived realities of selected families that mirror the province's complexities. They are the
            microcosms of a broader narrative, the individual threads in the province's socioeconomic tapestry. As we
            narrow our lens to the intimate scale of domestic life, we encounter three households, each a testament to
            the diversity and challenge of economic sustenance in the region.
            </p>

        <p>Based on the most recent data model, we filtered 728 surveyed households in Hebei Province, focusing on two
            key financial indicators: family asset income and non-housing debt. These two metrics directly impact
            household financial status and are closely related to Hebei's per capita disposable income. According to the
            2020 data, the average family income for these 728 households is 60,847 yuan, with an average non-housing
            debt of 14,350 yuan. Subtracting the latter from the former, we derived an average disposable income of
            46,497 yuan for the sampled households in Hebei. Based on this data, we selected three representative
            households. These households' disposable income levels fall into the 20,000 yuan range, the 50,000 yuan
            range, and the 70,000 yuan range, respectively. Following the principle of normal distribution, these income
            levels are evenly distributed around the mean income of 60,874 yuan. Therefore, we believe that selecting
            these three households can better represent the diversity of family incomes in Hebei Province, thus allowing
            for a more comprehensive exploration of the region's economic trends and current status.
        </p>
        <p>In selecting these three households, we considered the following reasons:
            Representativeness: The income levels of these three households cover different segments of family incomes
            in Hebei Province, reflecting the economic diversity and complexity of the region. Data credibility: The
            data from these three households is highly reliable, providing valuable insights that accurately reflect the
            economic conditions in Hebei Province. Comparability: By comparing the situations of these three households,
            we can better understand the living conditions and economic pressures of families at different income
            levels, thus informing future research and policy-making.

        <p>After scrutinizing the circumstances of the three families, our assessment of the economic landscape in Hebei
            may not remain entirely sanguine. The first family, emblematic of the low-income demographic, exhibits
            commendable prudence in budgeting, prioritizing education expenditures despite their modest means. However,
            it is questionable whether such a substantial investment in education always yields commensurate returns.
            China's hefty per capita investment in education raises doubts about the correlation between education and
            wealth accumulation, especially when juxtaposed with the second family's financial struggles, where high
            living costs erode the lion's share of their income, and leaving little room for savings. This prompts a
            reevaluation of the traditional Chinese belief that knowledge inevitably leads to prosperity.
        </p>
        <p>So, where does the future truly lie? This question weighs heavily on the minds of the younger generation.
            Regrettably, the glimmer of prosperity we observe in the third family is overshadowed by their reliance on
            rental income, which, while surpassing Hebei's average disposable income, signifies a departure from
            traditional labor-based income.
            In the reawakening optimism of post-pandemic China, these families embody the intricate tapestry of economic
            vibrancy and fragility. Their narratives reflect the nuanced realities of Hebei's economic landscape, where
            progress and prosperity do not uniformly advance.
            The resilience of the first family underscores a steadfast belief in education's transformative potential,
            while the struggles of the second family challenge assumptions about the relationship between education and
            wealth. The third family serves as a reminder that prosperity can stem from unconventional sources,
            transcending traditional labor paradigms.
            Amidst the economic tumult catalyzed by three years of COVID-19 upheaval, Hebei and similarly positioned
            provinces find themselves at a critical juncture. Situated in the middle to lower echelons of the national
            per capita disposable income rankings, they confront a pressing need for rejuvenation and revitalization.
            Yet, the traditional pathways to prosperity, anchored in "non-fixed" assets, prove inadequate in navigating
            these turbulent times. Despite the promising announcement from Xijin Ping of the "Xiongan New Area" plan in
            2017, anticipated economic surges reminiscent of the Pearl River Delta or Shenzhen Special Economic Zone
            fail to materialize, leaving questions lingering about the efficacy of regional development strategies.
            Looking ahead, the upcoming CFPS surveys slated for 2022 and 2024 hold promise in illuminating potential
            recovery trajectories. However, until concrete evidence emerges, the quest for sustainable growth remains a
            paramount challenge.
